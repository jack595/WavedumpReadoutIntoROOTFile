To compile new_txt_tree.C and make binary executable, run

>> make new_txt_tree

Then the executable named "new_txt_tree" will be generated. 
To convert a wave0.txt to ROOT under current directory, run 

>> new_txt_tree ./wave0.txt ./event1.root

event1.root will be saved in the current directory.

Everytime any edits made to new_txt_tree.C, you need to repeat the first
step to generate the executable again, so that the changes are updated.
